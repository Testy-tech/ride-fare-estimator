# ride-fare-estimator
A machine learning model to estimate taxi fares using real-world data.
# 🚖 Ride Fare Estimator

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict NYC taxi ride fares based on features like distance, trip time, and pickup time. Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn** in **Google Colab**.

## 🔍 Problem
Can we estimate the cost of a ride based on trip details alone?

## 📊 Dataset
Sample of NYC taxi data from [DataTalksClub GitHub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data)

## ⚙️ Features Used
- Distance in kilometers
- Pickup time
- Trip duration
- Passenger count

## ✅ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🧠 Model
- Linear Regression
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² Score

## 📈 Result
The model was able to predict fares with reasonable accuracy and helps demonstrate how regression models work in the real world.
